\chapter{Concluding remarks} % (fold)
\label{cha:concluding_remarks}

The purpose of this project was twofold. First, three image quality evaluations assessment techniques were analyzed. The technique chosen for implementation was SAMVIQ which is best suited for rating images under various conditions where the impairments are small.

Secondly, an application was developed based on the chosen assessment technique. The application is web-based and is able to demonstrate the core concepts of the SAMVIQ methodology.

\section{Future work} % (fold)
\label{sec:future_work}

The web application is not quiet ready to be used for image quality evaluation assessment. The application will need a start page together with an initial training scene from which an observer will be carefully trained in the process of the evaluation \cite{Kozamernik2005}.

It would be beneficial to have an end page for the web application from where the observer would be thanked for participating. This page could contain information about the evaluation and the use of the assessed data.
