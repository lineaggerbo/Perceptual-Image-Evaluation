\chapter{Introduction}
This report describes the process of a Research and Development project carried out at Aarhus University. The project is developed as a subproject of a Master Thesis which is carried out in in spring 2016. The purpose of the Master Thesis is to conduct a statistical comparison of subjective image quality evaluation with objective image quality metrics, e.g. MSE, PSNR, and SSIM.

The purpose of this Research and Development project is to analyze multiple subjective image quality evaluation assessment techniques. From this analysis one assessment technique is chosen to be carried out. This project leads to an implemented application which will be used in the Master Thesis described above.

All design and implementation choices made throughout this project is reasoned described in this report together with screen shots from the final implementation of the application.
